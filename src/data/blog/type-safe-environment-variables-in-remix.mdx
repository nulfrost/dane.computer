There are many was you can get type-safe variables in your projects, I've tried a few but recently found the t3-env package which makes it even easier and comes with some nice features as well. I will quickly walk through how to set this up in a Remix project.

## Install t3-env

As of writing this, currently you can't just bring in any validation library so you will need to install `zod` as well.

```bash
npm install @t3-oss/env-core zod
```

## Create a new `env.server.ts` file

Inside of the `/app` directory, create a file named `env.server.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
// app/env.server.ts

import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    // whatever else you may need
  },
});
```

Then, to access the environment variables in your loaders or actions or anywhere you might need them, you would just need to import the `env` object and use it like this:

```typescript
import { env } from "~/env.server";

export async function loader() {
  const dbUrl = env.server.DATABASE_URL;
  // do something with the dbUrl
}
```

This is enough to get type-safety for your environment variables, but we can go even further.

If you want to add runtime validation you just need to add a single property:

```typescript
export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  runtimeEnv: process.env,
});
```

and then you'll need to import the `env.server.ts` file into the `entry.server.tsx` file like so:

```diff
// app/entry.server.tsx

import { PassThrough } from "node:stream";

import type { AppLoadContext, EntryContext } from "@remix-run/node";
import { createReadableStreamFromReadable } from "@remix-run/node";
import { RemixServer } from "@remix-run/react";
import { isbot } from "isbot";
import { renderToPipeableStream } from "react-dom/server";
+ import "~/env.server.ts";
```

On top of that, if you want to override the default error handler, you can do so like this:

```typescript
export const env = createEnv({
  onValidationError: (error) => {
    throw new Error(
      `Invalid environment configuration, missing the following variables: ${error.errors.map((error) => error.path[0]).join(", ")}`,
    );
  },
  // ...
});
```

Putting that all together you should end up with a file that looks like this:

```typescript
// app/env.server.ts

import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  onValidationError: (error) => {
    throw new Error(
      `Invalid environment configuration, missing the following variables: ${error.errors.map((error) => error.path[0]).join(", ")}`,
    );
  },
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: process.env,
});
```

If you want to see all of the features available in the t3-env package, I recommend checking out [the official documentation](https://env.t3.gg/docs/introduction).
